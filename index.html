    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I am Logan Reese! The baby of 7 children, with 3 of my own. Air Force veteran, mechanic, and tinkerer. Some call me Logi Bear.
      <br>I have completed some college, a handful of technical schools and a year of an electrical apprenticeship.
      <br>Most of my jobs have been centered around mechanical and electrical. Ive been an aircraft mechanic, firetruck mechanic, armored vehicle fabrication and repairs mechanic and <br>an apprentice electrician. Did I say the word mechanic yet? Mechanic.
      <br>My goals are to become a python developer and land a sweet gig on my butt. My body is tired.
