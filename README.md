#### Reflection From Journal
Every day I am learning something new in conjunction with things I have learned prior and refreshing out-of-practice skills. Today I learned about the template literal method for concatenating rather than plus signs in HTML. Using this going forward will make me more comfortable with concepts learned that I have never used before. In this way, I am planning and learning which learned skills I find most valuable and the ones that I don't think I would use unless directed to. Anything that I comprehend (which is a mound to a mountain of information right now) I will take with me and attempt at least once. As of now, I am evaluating every day what I want to learn within reading material and the course work as it proceeds because if I were to focus on what I truly want to know, Python, I would overwhelm myself and explode from knowledge overload. I am trusting the process and taking it one day at a time, with adult-sized baby steps. A shuffle if you will.
